Employees bring their own devices to work.  
In the past employees might have had a dedicated company device. 
Today around 70\% of companies have a BYOD scheme~\cite{schulze_byod_2016} and, in some fields,
  85\% of staff use their personal devices to look up work-sensitive information~\cite{patel_uk_2015}. 
This creates a challenge for IT departments.
They need to control access to company resources, but have limited control over the devices used to access them.

One common solution to control devices is to require users to agree to follow a policy.
These policies take the form of user agreements, written in natural language, which describe how the devices should be used and configured.
Various guides are available for companies wishing to implement a policy from governments, standards bodies, and companies seeking to advise~\cite{nicholas_r._c._guerin_security_2008,souppaya_guidelines_????,hp_byod_????,cesg_byod_2015}.
On top of user agreements companies may also use \ac{MDM} software, which can enforce some policies automatically.
The use of \ac{MDM} software does not guarantee compliance however.
One survey found over 50\% of companies with \ac{MDM} software still have uncompliant devices in their networks~\cite{mobileiron_security_labs_q4_2015}.

BYOD policies are becoming more complex and \ac{MDM} software is becoming more proficient.
There has been much work looking at developing the \ac{MDM} software to enforce aspects of BYOD policies~\cite{costantino_towards_2013,martinelli_enhancing_2016,armando_enabling_2014}.
Enforcing a policy is only part of the problem, however.
BYOD policies are specified informally using natural language, and they contain more than just access control decisions.
These policies describe trust relationships inside the company between the IT departments, users, and HR each who may be delegated to make decisions and provide rules.
Policies contain rules that require employees to acknowledge risks, and regulations.
An antivirus or \ac{MDM} program may be used to \emph{implement} part of a policy, but it is the policy which \emph{specifies} which software to use and when; there is no automatic way to check how a policy has been implemented and by what.

This paper describes a formalization of five BYOD policies using AppPAL---a policy language for mobile device privacy preferences~\cite{hallett_apppal_2016}.
Using our formalization we identify the common concerns and trust relationships in these policies.
We show how AppPAL can be used to implement these policies, and describe precisely the different trust relationships.
AppPAL is an instantiation of the SecPAL authorization language~\cite{becker_secpal:_2010} for mobile device policies.
We have found, however, that it is a good fit for other policies surround the mobile ecosystem as well~\cite{hallett_specifying_2016}.
Using these papers we identify a set of standard decisions and trust relationships used in BYOD policies.
These are BYOD idioms that are capture decisions at common requirements in BYOD policies.
These give a guide for where future work implementing BYOD tools should focus their efforts to cover more aspects of policies.

\section{My Idea}
\label{sec:idea}
% 2 pages

Corporate BYOD policies are tricky to fully enforce.
Part of their policies are prescriptive:  if you configure your device in this way you will mitigate that threat.
The policies contain more than just configuration, however.
Consider this rule taken from the \emph{Security Policy for the use of handheld devices in corporate environments} by SANS~\cite{nicholas_r._c._guerin_security_2008}:

\newcommand{\textbra}[1]{\ensuremath{\left\langle \text{\sffamily #1} \right\rangle}}
\begin{quote}
  Digital camera embedded on handheld devices \emph{might} be disabled in restricted environments, according to \textbra{COMPANY NAME} risk analysis. 
  In sensitive facilities, information can be stolen using pictures and possibly sent using MMS or E-mail services.

  In high-security facilities such as R\&D labs or design manufacturers, camera MUST be disabled.
  Furthermore, MMS messages should be disabled as well, to prevent malicious users from sending proprietary pictures.
\end{quote}

To implement this policy an \ac{MDM} program, such as IBM's MaaS360 could be used~\cite{_ibm_????}.
This software supports app wrapping (where an app is recompiled to use guarded APIs), and supports security ``checkboxes'' to enable security controls and access control policies.
Using techniques like this would implement the recommendation within the rule, but the rule itself contains more than just configuration to implement.  
It talks of \emph{restricted environments} decided by \emph{company risk analysis}; but how is this communicated to the device?
Does it access the list of restricted environments once, from a server?
Does it understand how the risk analysis was performed?  
Can it decide on the basis of a policy if a location is restricted?
The rule also gives a security objective: \emph{prevent malicious users from sending proprietary pictures}.
The guidelines are given, however, for the specific cases of a compliant user using MMS or email.
This may not be sufficient to stop a sufficiently motivated \emph{malicious} user.

Our approach does not try to implement the policy.
Rather we attempt to capture the goals of the policy rule so that the delegations of trust, tools used, and their configuration is made explicit.
This gives us greater clarity as to which tool is being trusted to implement what policy.
It allows us to see who is being trusted to make which decisions.
It also lets us use automatic tools to uncover aspects of the policy that may be unimplemented~\cite{hallett_specifying_2016}.
Continuing with the example above, this can be expressed in AppPAL as:

\begin{lstlisting}
'company' says 'risk-analysis' can-say 
  Location:L isHighSecurityFacility.

'company' says Device:D mustDisableIn(Location, 'camera')
  if Location isHighSecurityFacility.

'company' says Device:D mustDisableIn(Location, 'mms') 
  if Location isHighSecurityFacility.

'company' says User:U hasSatisfied('proprietary pictures policy')
  if U hasDevice(D),
     D mustDisableIn(Location, 'camera'),
     D mustDisableIn(Location, 'mms'),
     Location isHighSecurityFacility.
\end{lstlisting}

\todo{%
  Why is the apppal better?
  Clearer, explicit, can identify problems automatically.
  
  Explain why I'm trying to build a schema for byod policies and why this is worth a paper.
  
  How is this falsifiable?
  Examples of policy idioms we can't express.
